## Thoughtful Code Engineering Technical Screen

This is a technical screen for Thoughtful Code Engineering. To show my train of thought/understanding of the task, I didn't use LLM tools beyond Supermaven in a Neovim editor using conventional LSPs.

Normally I use Claude Code and/or Codex to offload tasks like documentation & expanding tests, but I feel like that would defeat the core purpose of the exercise.

To run the screen, you'll need to use the [bun test runner](https://bun.com/docs/cli/test).

Run the following to test with coverage:
```bash
bun test --coverage
```
